## LLM Explanation
Here's a summary of the planned infrastructure changes:

1. **New Web Server**: A new AWS EC2 instance named "web_server" will be added. This typically means a new virtual machine will be set up to host web applications or services.

2. **S3 Bucket Update**: The existing S3 bucket named "logs_bucket" will be modified. This could involve changes to its configuration, such as permissions, versioning, or lifecycle rules.

3. **New Security Group**: A new security group called "web_sg" will be created. Security groups control inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources, so this will likely define rules for accessing the new web server.

4. **New Load Balancer**: An application load balancer named "app_lb" will be added. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, to ensure reliability and performance.

5. **New Target Group**: A target group named "app_tg" will be created. This is used by the load balancer to direct traffic to specific instances or services.

6. **Database Removal**: The existing database instance "prod_db" will be destroyed. This means the database will be permanently deleted, so any data stored there will be lost unless backed up elsewhere.

7. **IAM Role Update**: The IAM role "ec2_role" will be modified. IAM roles define permissions for AWS resources, so this change could involve updating what actions EC2 instances can perform.

8. **New CloudWatch Log Group**: A new log group named "app_logs" will be added in CloudWatch. This will help in collecting and monitoring logs for applications, aiding in troubleshooting and performance analysis.
